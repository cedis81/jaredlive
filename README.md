# Jared Video Pages
Jared gives talks at many conferences and meet-ups. These video pages serve as a resource that helps people at the talks understand how to connect with us.
- In advance of the presentation, these can be easily shared so attendees have something to look forward to. These have been shared by Jared and conference organizers on social media during and after an event. So far, none of these have been shared prior to an event, but an event host may have the option to do so.
- During the presentation, he references related topics that he cannot go in depth on, but attendees can refer to these resources after the presentation. Attendees have shared these links on their own social media, expressing their enjoyment from listening to Jared speak.
- Finally, after the presentation, attendees can refer to the video page to get missing notes, related content, and be given an opportunity to share the presentation with others (including, but not limited to, leaders within their organization).
- With these links, Jared provides attendees a next step interaction with UIE, and a means to share the resources with individuals who could not attend.
- This could lead to additional conversations that may become sales leads, new speaking engagements, coaching calls or just additional conversations on how Jared and UIE can help other companies and those in the UX community.

While this repo is titled "jaredlive", this project is NOT the same as the [Jared Live page](https://www.uie.com/jared-live/) that currently exists on uie.com. Some, but not all, of the content is the same. The Jared Live page shows eight total presentations on the same page, where the individual pages in this repo each focus only one of these topics. The Jared Live page also does not have easily shareable links (bulky links with anchor tags in the URL), where the intent of these pages is to have an easy to remember link that can be shared easily. At the moment there are no plans to remove Jared Live or alter it in any way. For now, these will exist simultaneously until needs change.

[Link to user scenarios](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lqC9rIqYmJcV5DrvvBW4lFe4mhI_HTWQyopgehbbjrw/) that drove the below list of **priorities**:
1. Easy to share URL
2. Video can be played
3. Easily accessible related resources (presentation slides, transcripts, articles and blogs referenced in the presentation)
4. CTA to sign up for the _UX Strategy with Jared Spool_ newsletter
5. Form to contact Jared

This project started with intern Ricardo De Jesus, who created the first set of scenarios and sketches. Intern Gabriela Quesada created the first set of pages using Bootstrap. Intern Cedric Hom took Gabriela's page, and changed it from Bootstrap to Flexbox (uie.com was not built with Bootstrap), and took v1 live with direction from Adam, Summer, Leslie and Jared. Scenarios were updated and designs changed. Some next steps are listed below. The original Bootstrap file created by Gabriela is still in this repo, named team_v1.html.

### Create a New Page
To create a new page, you will need the following:
- Link to the video (provided by Jared)
- Transcript file for the video
- Slides for the presentation given in the video
- Copy to describe the video (provided by Jared, Leslie, Summer or Adam)

Steps:
1. In iTerm, navigate to directory /Users/Shared/jaredlive
2. git pull origin master to ensure you have the most up-to-date files
3. git checkout -b <new branch name> from the master branch to do your work
4. In Atom, duplicate an existing video page
5. Update the following HTML sections:
    1. h1 title to the title of the video
    2. Update the video link
    3. Update the link to transcript. Need a new transcript? Refer to that section below
    4. Update the link to presentation slides. Need new slides? Refer to that section below
    5. Update the copy beneath the video
    6. Update the link, title, and by-line (if necessary) of each card in the related content section at the bottom. You may need to add or remove card divs accordingly. Link to the related content is in the section below
    7. Unless directed by Jared or someone else, that should be the only changes needed to the template
    8. git push origin <branch>
    9. Have other intern review changes on GitHub, accept pull request and merge to master
6. Log in to uie.com Wordpress account
7. Navigate to "Pages" on the dashboard on the left side of the screen
8. At the top of the page, click "Add New"
9. In the "Enter title here" field, populate the title of the presentation
10. Below that, edit the Permalink. It should be one or two words from the talk, maximum, to ensure ease of sharing.
11. Copy and paste the code from Atom into the WYSIWYG, then click on the preview button in the top right corner. Review for accuracy (ensure video plays, links go to the right resource, typos)
12. Once everything looks good, you can publish. Share with the team for additional sets of eyes to review

**Making Updates to Design**
1. In WordPress, there is a page called "Video page test" that you can use to preview working code. Click on that page to edit
2. Copy and paste the code from Atom into the WYSIWYG, then click on the preview button in the top right corner
3. Continue to use this page for any development needs, especially the Chrome developer tools to inspect and to view changes directly on this preview page
4. When desired changes have been made and reviewed on this page, you can go ahead and put those changes into the respective video page (step 8 above)
5. Be sure to push the changes to GitHub

Any other content that needs to be updated can be done in Atom, then pasted into the page on WordPress.

### Assets and Other Resources

**Transcripts** are located in /home/uiewp/uiewp/wp-assets/transcripts and can be accessed through Transmit.

If a transcript does not exist, a new one will need to be generated on [rev.com](https://www.rev.com/). Speak with Adam for authorization to generate this transcript. You simply need to add a link to the video, and rev will generate a transcript. From there, follow steps 1-7 from the ["Putting the Transcript in Place" section in notion](https://www.notion.so/centercentre/AYCL-New-Seminar-Release-f607f76923734f4ab055502b88036952).

1. Download a prior transcript from /home/uiewp/uiewp/wp-assets/transcripts directory in Transmit by right-clicking and selecting download. This file will be saved in /Users/intern.
2. Open it in Atom by going to file > open > Users > intern. Save it as a new HTML file on your desktop. Then you'll want to update the following:
    1. Title in BOTH the head tag and in the h1 in the div with id="header"
    2. Link for the h1 in the div with id="header"
    3. The location and date of the presentation in the small tag in the div with id="header"
    4. Replace the p tags with the new transcript content in the div with id="article"
3. Once that is complete, you can transfer the file to the /home/uiewp/uiewp/wp-assets/transcripts directory on the server.
4. Right click the file in Transmit and copy URL. Paste the link in your browser to ensure it opens the transcript you just updated, and check that the content is correct. You will need to replace "sftp://asset.uie.com//home/uiewp/uiewp" with "https://www.uie.com" in your browser.

**Slides** are located /home/asset/slides and can be accessed through Transmit. The original slides are located in Jared's Dropbox folder that is pinned in the #web_intern_projects channel. You will want to ensure you use the latest version number for the slides.

[Link to related content](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-pBnNEFN2qIBA5fWYe37hhlG9I1K0KxVdu6vhnVlQqI/) that will populate the article cards beneath the video. Jared is the best person to update and provide this content.

### Future considerations:
Below are unresolved issues to be addressed in future versions:  
1. Including a contact form. Current challenges are how to create a means to contact Jared without seeming like it will invite a sales call, and where to place it on the page. Part of the issue is getting the right copy.
2. Descriptions for each related article and why a user would want to click on the link for the resource. Current challenge is how to fit that in stylistically.
3. Adding open graph (OG) images to each individual page so that when it is shared, it shows either a picture of Jared giving a talk, or a slide from the talk instead of the UIE logo. Current issue is the header page is pulling a set of OG tags as part of the header from WordPress.
4. Adding open graph (OG) text with a short description of the talk, instead of the UIE line. Current issue is the header page is pulling a set of OG tags as part of the header from WordPress.
